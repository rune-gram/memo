[concept -> scanner stratcher]
    [SCAN By Token, Allocate]

[concept -> allocation checker] [FOR ONE TIME RUN ONLY]
    [ALLOC heap (BTreeMap)]
    - [VSCAN -> allocate variable and calculate token]
    - [FSCAN -> future scan to check is there any more variable assigned in current + c(n)]
    - [DSCAN -> delete used variable to free up upper heap, except for the cached one]

[concept -> instruction] [ASYNC/SYNC REPETITIVE RUN]
    [FN(x)]
    - [Allocate function to another BTreeMap]
    - [DSCAN -> delete used function if there is no future usage of the function as long as it's lifetime]
